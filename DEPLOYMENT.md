# Deploying OptimaTrading v2.1 to Render (Free Plan)

## Prerequisites

1. A Render account (sign up at https://render.com)
2. Git repository with your OptimaTrading v2.1 code
3. Python 3.9.13 (specified in runtime.txt)

## Configuration Files

The following files have been configured for Render deployment:

- `render.yaml`: Service definitions
- `requirements.txt`: Production dependencies
- `requirements-dev.txt`: Development dependencies
- `runtime.txt`: Python version specification
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore patterns

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables in Render:

- `SECRET_KEY`: Automatically generated by Render
- `ENVIRONMENT`: Set to "production"
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set to "INFO"
- `MAX_WORKERS`: Set to "1" for free plan
- `REDIS_URL`: Automatically set by Render

## Deployment Steps

1. Connect your repository to Render:
   - Go to https://dashboard.render.com
   - Click "New +"
   - Select "Blueprint"
   - Connect your repository
   - Select the repository with OptimaTrading

2. Render will automatically:
   - Detect the `render.yaml`
   - Create the web service and Redis instance
   - Deploy your application

## Free Plan Limitations

- 512 MB RAM
- Shared CPU
- 750 hours/month
- Auto-sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- 1 GB disk space

## Performance Optimizations

The configuration has been optimized for the free plan:

1. Single worker with 8 threads
2. Redis for caching and rate limiting
3. Minimal dependencies
4. Memory-efficient settings
5. Proper timeout configurations

## Monitoring

Monitor your application through:

1. Render Dashboard
2. Application logs
3. `/health` endpoint
4. Prometheus metrics (if enabled)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. Memory limits:
   - Check memory usage in Render dashboard
   - Reduce worker count if needed
   - Implement proper garbage collection

2. Timeouts:
   - Adjust gunicorn timeout settings
   - Implement proper async handling
   - Use background tasks for long operations

3. Cold starts:
   - First request after inactivity may be slow
   - Consider upgrading to paid plan to avoid this
